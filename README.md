# hello-world
The Hello World project:
A time-honored tradition in computer programming, it's a simple exercise that gets you started when learning something new. So, let's get started!

About myself:
Hi Everyone,
Darnell here, aka Dannell - it's a long story but something I would be happy to share over some beer! I enjoy sports, reading books, entertainment, watching movies and box-sets etc. I have a passion for football, it's something that runs deep in my family. I also enjoy my work in the creative digital media industry, I have over 10 years experience working for large blue chip companies such as, Cable & Wireless, Virgin Media, BBC and now Disney. The hello world project will be the catalyst, in helping me to learn the python programming language and improve on my existing skills & abilities.
